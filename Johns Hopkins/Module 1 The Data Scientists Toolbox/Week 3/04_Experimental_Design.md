# Experimental Design


## Why you should care
* Genomic signatures to guide the use of chemotherapeutics
  * Flawed study design and statistical analysis
  * Ongoing study now in clinical trials 
  * Led to lawsuit due to poor outcomes as result of bad predictions based on experimental analysis

##  Have a plan for data and code sharing
  * GitHub
    * good for small amounts
  * figshare
    * good for larger
  * https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing

##  Formulate your question in advance


##  Confounding
* Randomization and blocking
  * If you can and want to fix a variable
  * If you don't fix a variable, stratify it, to use variables equally
  * If you can't do anything then use randomization
    * Why does randomization help?

##  Prediction v. Inference
  * Prediction is more difficult than inference

##  Prediction Key Quantities
* Senesitivity    --> Pr( positive test | disease)
* Specificity     --> Pr(negative test | no disease)
* Positive Predictive Value   --> Pr(disease | positive test)
* Negative Predictive Value   --> Pr(no disease | negative test)
* Accuracy        --> Pr(correct outcome)

##  Beware data dredging
